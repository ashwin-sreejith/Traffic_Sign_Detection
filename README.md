# 🚦 Traffic Sign Classification: Shape & Type 🚦

Welcome to our project! We're developing two classifiers to identify traffic signs based on their shape and type. Our work is based on a modified version of the Belgium Traffic Sign Classification Benchmark dataset.

Here's how our repository is organized:

- 📁 `models`: Houses the models trained.
- 📁 `Dataset`: Stores the datasets used for training.

📜 The dataset is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
